# PROGRAMMING PROJECT #2

# 1. Leaving the current tab unchanged, open www.online-python.com in a new tab.

# 2. In the new tab, delete all the code, and copy over only the multiply function. Now, Type in the following code,
#    below the multiply function, which prints the numbers from 0 to 12.

for i in range(13):
    print(f'{i}')

# 3. Using your multiply function can you print out times table for 9? Now, can you change this
#    so it prints out the 9 times table for numbers up to 15?

# 4. In programming, parts of the code can be conditionally executed. For example:

if 10 > 5:
    print('Of course 10 is bigger than 5!')

#    How could you use this to change your program to only display results greater than 50? Now, only
#    display numbers less than 100.
