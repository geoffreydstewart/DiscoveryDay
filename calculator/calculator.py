# PROGRAMMING PROJECT #2

# 1. Using the code in the first tab, from Project 1, can you implement a simple calculator that can
#    add, subtract, multiply and divide?

# 2. Hint1: You could use a line of code like this to take the operation input.

#    Hint2: You can handle the different “operations” using conditionals, like this:

#    Hint 3: To handle numbers with decimals you need to use the correct data type. Change the
#    data type of the input from int (integers) to float (floating point numbers).
